you are the hero
(git clone #link#) to clone the folder to the local
(cd #folder_name#) it goes to the folder were we need to work
(git add #file name#) file goes to the staging area
(git status) gives the status of the file to be added
{
    first in red color -> git add #filename# -> normal
}
(git commit -m "#commit msg#") -> that file goes to the local git folder
(git push origin main) that file goes to the GitHub on web
(git pull) to update changes the happened in the GitHub to the system


now create a folder in the system and put it in the github 

(cd..) goes back to the orignal folder in the system
(git init) change the normally created folder to github folder
(git add .) it makes all the modified to the staging area
(git commit -m#msg#)
Next to this step we normally give git push origin main, but here it won't works.
first we need to create a new repository in the GitHubim, it's is name as same as in system folder and give
(git remote add origin #link#) this direct the computer to the new repository

here branch is new, to know branch name give
(git branch) -> gives the current branch name

to change the branch name give
(git branch -M #name to be changed#)

(git push origin main)

how branches works:
(git branch -a) list out all the branches in the current repository 
 
to go to another branch
(git checkout #branch to go#)

now we are in main branch if we give
(git diff #other branch name#) -> it gives the difference between main branch and the other branch which is entered 
 
now we are in main branch, if we need to merge the main branch and other branch, give
(git merge #other branch name#) -> along with
(git push origin main)
